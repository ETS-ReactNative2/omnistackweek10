# SemanaOmnistack10

Project produced at the [10th Omnistack Week](https://rocketseat.com.br/week-10/inscricao) promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

My LinkedIn post: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6624636245584818176/

This was a week to motivate people to elevate their careers as programmers getting to know Node.JS, React and React Native for Front-end, Back-end and Mobile development.

The idea this time was to develop an application that was a developer radar named DevRadar.

The Front-end was responsible for providing an interface for registering and listing developers.

The Back-end was responsible for communicating with a MongoDB database, communicating with the GitHub API and managing the sending of data to users of the application.

The mobile application was responsible for providing a map with all developers within 10km of you who work with the technologies you are interested in.

Like a cherry on the cake, the Back-end still works with real time, that is, when a new user signs up on the platform, the map of other users is updated instantly.
